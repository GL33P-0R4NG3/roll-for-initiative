# roll-for-initiative
Purpose of this bot is to supply DnD tools for discord (full list of features described bellow). I wanted to make DM-ing better experience via discord.

## Install
These steps are required to run the bot:

### config-template.json
Just copy and/or rename this file to `config.json` and you have template of used settings for this bot. You will need bot token - this is something like password KEEP IN SECRET! - next app ID both of these can be found on [discord developer portal][dev_portal] and last optional thing is guild ID which is your discord server ID where you can test features before publishing them to all servers.

## File structure
Folder commands_dev is used for testing commands before publishing them on all servers.
